# Global-Game-Jam-2018

 Unity2D Projet realized during [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/), from 26 to 28 january 2018.

## Description

This game is a werewolf game, the goal is to transmit "loupgarisme" (werewolf disease).  
To do this, you have to chase away the villagers and turn them into werewolves.

## Theme

During Global Game Jam, at the beginning of the week-end, the organization gave us the theme. This year, the theme was "TRANSMISSION". After thinking, we decided to do transmission of werewolf disease.

## Game

You are a werewolf, and you have to chase away villagers. You have 10 HP.  
The map is randomly generated in the beginning of the game, with villagers, walls, and landmines.  
If you walk on a landmine you will lose 2 HP.  
If your HP drop to 0, you will die and will become a gravestone (have to restart the game).  
A wall has 4 HP. You can hit them with E key of your keyboard.
Wall will lose 1 HP by hit. If its HP drops to 0, he will disappear.  
A villager has 12 HP. When a villager is hit by you with R key of your keyboard, he losts 3 HP.  
If his HP drops to 0, he becomes a werewolf.  
For winning, you have to transmit "loupgarisme" to each villager of the map.
